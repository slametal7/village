            A naturist resort or nudist resort is an establishment that provides accommodation (or at least camping space) and other amenities for guests in a context where they are invited to practice naturism – that is, a lifestyle of non-sexual social nudity. A smaller, more rustic, or more basic naturist resort may be called a naturist camp.<br/><br/>A naturist club is an association of people who practise naturism together, but the phrase is also frequently used as a synonym for "naturist resort", since in general such a resort will be run by such an association. In the United Kingdom and New Zealand, some naturist clubs are referred to as sun clubs.<br/><br/>A naturist community is an intentional community whose members choose to live together and practise naturism on a permanent basis. Naturist communities were once referred to as nudist colonies, and this term still exists in popular culture, but it is avoided by most naturists today due to negative connotations.<br/><br/>Naturist resorts and communities exist on a spectrum without sharp distinctions – a naturist resort might be primarily commercial in focus but also accommodate some permanent residents, while a naturist community might be primarily residential but also cater to some paying visitors. Some naturist resorts and communities require nudity as a condition of remaining on the site; others are clothing-optional, allowing people to wear clothing so long as they tolerate others going nude.<br/><br/>A few naturist communities are large enough to host businesses such as shops, banks, and restaurants; these may be referred to as naturist villages. Examples include Vera Playa in Spain, and Centre Hélio-Marin Montalivet and the Naturist Village in Cap d'Agde, both in France.
