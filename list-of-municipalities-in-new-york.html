            This is a list of municipalities in New York other than towns, which includes all 532 villages and 62 cities of New York. Of the total 594  municipalities, 587 are non-town municipalities, while six are coterminous town-villages, villages that are coterminous with their town, and one is a consolidated town-village, where the village is smaller in size and population than the town, but they still share the same government.<br/><br/>At the time of the 2010 United States Census, the state of New York had 555 villages. Since then, two villages were created (Mastic Beach in Suffolk County and Tuxedo in Orange County) and 25 villages were dissolved (including Mastic Beach, after only seven years of incorporation).  Although still listed in the 2023 population estimates from the US Census, this includes the village of Fort Johnson (dissolved December 31, 2023).<br/><br/>Most municipalities in New York are located within a single town and county, but some municipalities are located in more than one town. Of those, there are two cities and eight villages located in more than one county:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Geneva, in Ontario &amp; Seneca Counties, although the portion in Seneca County has no population and is entirely water<br/><br/>New York, in Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens &amp; Richmond Counties<br/><br/>Almond, in Allegany &amp; Steuben Counties<br/><br/>Attica, in Genesee &amp; Wyoming Counties<br/><br/>Deposit, in Broome &amp; Delaware Counties<br/><br/>Dolgeville, in Fulton &amp; Herkimer Counties<br/><br/>Earlville, in Chenago &amp; Madison Counties<br/><br/>Gowanda, in Cattaraugus &amp; Erie Counties<br/><br/>Rushville, in Ontario &amp; Yates Counties<br/><br/>Saranac Lake, in Essex &amp; Franklin Counties<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Former villages ==<br/><br/>Listed below are former villages in the State of New York which either dissolved, consolidated or were acquired by another municipality between 1900 and 2023. To date during this period, there are a total of 66 villages that have chosen dissolution. A former village does have the option to re-incorporate in the future if the community chooses to do so. Unless otherwise specified, these communities are currently (or will be) considered census-designated places by the U.S. Census Bureau.
