            IFC Center is an art house movie theater in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City. Located at 323 Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) at West 3rd Street, it was formerly the Waverly Theater, an art house movie theater. IFC Center is owned by AMC Networks (known until July 1, 2011, as Rainbow Media), the entertainment company that owns the cable channels AMC, BBC America, IFC, We TV and Sundance TV and the offshoot film company IFC Films.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description and history ==<br/><br/>AMC Networks has positioned the theater as an extension of its cable channel IFC (Independent Film Channel) because IFC was to take over the building. IFC has converted the historic building, originally built as a church in the early 19th century, into a three-, and eventually five-theater facility.  The theater is equipped to screen 35mm and high-definition digital video. The complex originally included digital editing suites, a meeting area, and a restaurant called The Waverly, in recognition of the site's past, but those spaces have since been converted. (The Waverly restaurant was closed and renovated into two additional screens, bringing the theater's total screen count to five in 2009.) In addition to regularly scheduled films, the Center plays host to special screenings such as premieres, educational programs and film festival screenings.<br/><br/>IFC Center opened on June 17, 2005, with the film Me and You and Everyone We Know, distributed by IFC Films. The opening was not without controversy; for the first several weeks, patrons were welcomed to the theater by a picket line and a giant inflatable rat.
