            The Pope of Greenwich Village is a 1984 American dramatic crime film directed by Stuart Rosenberg and starring Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts, Daryl Hannah, Geraldine Page, Kenneth McMillan and Burt Young. Page was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her two-scene role. The film was adapted by screenwriter Vincent Patrick from his novel of the same name. The film focuses on two cousins who initially work as waiting staff in Greenwich Village. After getting fired, they orchestrate a safe-cracking plot which would allow them financially to support the pregnant girlfriend of one of them. Following the robbery, they realize that they just robbed a local mobster, who starts pressuring them to repay him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>In an Italian neighborhood of Greenwich Village, cousins Charlie Moran, a maître d'hôtel with aspirations of someday owning his own restaurant, and Paulie Gibonni, a bungling schemer who works as a waiter, have expensive tastes but not much money. Paulie gets caught skimming checks, and he and Charlie are both fired. Now out of work and in debt, Charlie must find another way to pay his alimony, support his pregnant girlfriend Diane, and try to buy a restaurant.<br/><br/>Paulie comes to Charlie with a seemingly foolproof robbery idea involving a large amount of cash in the safe of a local business.
