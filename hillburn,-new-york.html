It is located north of Suffern, east of Orange County, south of Viola, and west of Montebello. It is considered to be one of the more rural communities in Rockland County.

These multiracial descendants were recognized in 1980 by the state as the Ramapough Mountain Indians; they also have centers of population in Mahwah and Ringwood, New Jersey, which were areas of frontier in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. For many years they lived by farming, hunting and fishing. They tended to marry within their community until the mid-twentieth century.<br/><br/>The village of Hillburn was founded in 1893; that year the first school in Hillburn was built on a plot of ground donated by J.B.
