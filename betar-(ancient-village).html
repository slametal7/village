            Betar (Biblical Hebrew: בֵּיתַּר, romanized: Bēttar), also spelled Beitar, Bethar or Bether, was an ancient Jewish town in the Judaean Mountains. Continuously inhabited since the Iron Age, it was the last standing stronghold of the Bar Kokhba revolt, and was destroyed by the Imperial Roman Army under Hadrian in 135 CE.<br/><br/>Ancient Betar's ruins can be found at the archeological site of Khirbet al-Yahud (Arabic: خربة اليهود, lit. 'Ruin of the Jews'), located about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) southwest of Jerusalem. It is located in the  Palestinian village of Battir, which preserves Betar's ancient name. Although it has never been systematically excavated, limited archaeological excavations have revealed remains associated with the Roman siege and destruction, such as defensive walls and arrowheads.<br/><br/>The Israeli settlement and city Beitar Illit, named after the ancient city, is also located nearby.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Name ==<br/><br/>Bēttar might mean the "place of the blade", based on the variant spelling found in the Jerusalem Talmud (Codex Leiden), where the place name is written בֵּיתתֹּר Bēṯ-Tor, the name may have simply been a contraction of two words, meaning "house of a dove." Alternatively, the name may have meant “house of Jether," a Judean clan living in this area of the Judean Mountains during the First Temple period according to 1 Chronicles 2:53.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Location ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Betar was perched on a hill about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) southwest of Jerusalem. Deep valleys to the west, north, and east of the hill surround it. It was situated on a declivity that rises to an elevation of about 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea-level. The Roman road that connected Jerusalem with Beit Gubrin before going on to Gaza passed through the Valley of Rephaim, which is to the north.
