            The Antiochian Village Retreat and Conference Center/Camp was founded in 1978 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Ligonier, Pennsylvania.  Owned and operated by the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, it consists of both a Camp and a Retreat and Conference Center.  In 1994, the Antiochian Village was the site of the Ligonier Meeting, an unprecedented and historic gathering of all Eastern Orthodox Christian bishops in the United States. The Antiochian Village also hosts other faith-based retreats, meetings and educational gatherings.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History of Antiochian Village ==<br/><br/>The Antiochian Village was founded by Metropolitan Philip (Saliba) of the Antiochian Archdiocese. Through his vision, leadership, and perseverance, he established the "Village" as spiritual oasis spread over 300 acres.  He dreamed of a place where children could meet for an Orthodox Christian camping experience and where adults would come to refresh their souls, retreat, relax, join together in worship, and grow closer to God. The 280-acre (110 ha) grounds were purchased from Camp Fairfield, a Presbyterian camp, in 1978, and the first camping season was the summer of 1979.  In his vision for this spiritual oasis, Metropolitan Philip desired to add a retreat and conference center, monastery, and retirement community to the existing camp.<br/><br/>In 1985, the first phase of the Heritage and Learning Center, now known as the Retreat and Conference Center, was built with 50 lodging rooms, 6 meetings rooms, and a dining hall.
