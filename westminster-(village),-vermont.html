            Westminster is a village in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 287 at the 2020 census.  Most of the village is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 as the Westminster Village Historic District.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geography ==<br/><br/>According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.3 sq mi (3.4 km2), all  land.  The village is centered on the junction of U.S. Route 5 with School and Grout Streets, and extends mainly along US 5.  Its western end is roughly Metcalf Drive and Cox Street, and its eastern end is the old cemetery.  On School Street, the district extends north at least as far as Thompson Road.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Westminster, located in the southeastern part of Vermont, was the first town to be chartered, in 1736 by the Province of Massachusetts Bay.  The layout of the village center took place in 1736–1737, and initially called for an unusually broad Main Street (now US 5).  The basic plan for the village today still shows elements of this plan, with a still-broad main road layout (reduced in width in 1781 after the original plan was deemed too wide), and in the placement of municipal and civic buildings.
