            Hungarian Village is located in Columbus, Ohio, south of downtown. It is located in Franklin County, within the boundaries of Parsons Avenue, South High Street, East Innis Avenue and Hinman Avenue.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Hungarian Village is contained within the original boundaries of the Merion estate, established by Nathaniel Merion in 1809.  The area is historically part of the Refugee Tract, which Congress granted as compensation to refugee soldiers from British Canada for their service in the American Revolutionary War.  It was populated first by early British and Nova Scotian settlers and later by many German, Italian, and Irish immigrants during the construction boom of the early 1900s, when the area became known as "Steelton."<br/><br/>A Hungarian Reformed Church was established in 1913 and later rebuilt in 1923.  Located at the intersection of East Woodrow Avenue and South Washington Avenue, the church is in the far south of the neighborhood.  A corner stone on the face of the Hungarian Reformed church is inscribed with “United Magyar Protestant Church June 26, 1921.”  This simple inscription links the church and its early Hungarian immigrant congregation to the Magyars of Hungary.   In 1922 there were an estimated to be 1,200 Magyars living in Columbus.<br/><br/>Many Hungarian refugees immigrated to the area during the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution, while many others settled in Cleveland, New Jersey, and New York. In 1973, Reverend Zoltan Szabo proposed the idea of defining the community as Hungarian Village, looking at the revitalization in nearby German Village as a model for a successful community.
