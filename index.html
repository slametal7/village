            Yazidism, also known as Sharfadin, is a monotheistic ethnic religion which has roots in pre-Zoroastrian Iranian religion, directly derived from the Indo-Iranian tradition. Its followers, called Yazidis, are a Kurdish-speaking community.<br/><br/>Yazidism includes elements of ancient Iranian religions, as well as elements of Judaism, Church of the East, and Islam. Yazidism is based on belief in one God who created the world and entrusted it into the care of seven Holy Beings, known as Angels. Preeminent among these Angels is Tawûsî Melek (lit. 'Peacock Angel', also spelled as Melek Taûs), who is the leader of the Angels and who has authority over the world. The religion of the Yazidis is a highly syncretistic one: Sufi influence and imagery can be seen in their religious vocabulary, especially in the terminology of their esoteric literature, but much of the mythology is non-Islamic, and their cosmogonies apparently have many points in common with those of ancient Iranian religions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>The name of Yazidi is a exonym. The Yazidi people and religion are named after Sultan Ezid. Most modern historians hold that the name Ezid derives from the name of Yazid I (c. 646–689), the second Caliph of Umayyad Caliphate. The Adawiyya existed in the Kurdish mountains before the 12th century, when Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir (1072–1078), a Sufi of Umayyad descent, settled there and attracted a following among the adherents of the movement.
