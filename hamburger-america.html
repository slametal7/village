            Hamburger America is a luncheonette-style hamburger restaurant located at 51 MacDougal Street in SoHo, Manhattan, New York City. It was founded in 2023 by American chef, television personality, and burger scholar George Motz as an homage to the history of the hamburger in the United States. Specializing in traditional smash burgers, French fries, sandwiches, and milk drinks including egg cream, the restaurant offers 11-stool counter service, booth and table seating, and take-out.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Hamburger America derives its name from founder George Motz's 2004 documentary film Hamburger America and 2018 book Hamburger America: A State-by-State Guide to 200 Great Burger Joints, which both chronicle the history of the hamburger in the United States and showcase regional burgers throughout the United States.<br/><br/>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Motz created the Burgerslide, "a socially distant burger delivery system" through which he delivered thousands of Oklahoma onion burgers out of his Brooklyn apartment and other pop-up locations. He then partnered with restaurant owners Jonathan and Andrew Schnipper to develop his first brick-and-mortar restaurant, which became Hamburger America. Motz's goal was to recreate "what hamburgers used to taste like" by using historically accurate ingredients and cooking processes.<br/><br/>Construction for Hamburger America broke ground in May 2023, with initial plans to open in July 2023. The restaurant eventually opened in November 2023, drawing notable guests on its opening day including Chris Rock, Sean Evans, Christy Turlington, and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.<br/><br/>Motz has considered expanding the restaurant to additional locations, but says that for the time being, he is "just trying to get one right".
