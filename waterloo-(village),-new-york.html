            Waterloo is a village and primary county seat of Seneca County, New York, United States. The population was 5,171 at the 2010 census and is now the most populated village in Seneca County. The village is named after  Waterloo,  Belgium, where Napoleon was defeated. It is the primary county seat of Seneca County, with the other being Ovid as part of a two-shire system established in 1822. Most of the county administrative offices are located in the village. Therefore, many political sources only list Waterloo as the county seat.<br/><br/>The Village of Waterloo is mostly in the Town of Waterloo, but the part south of the Cayuga-Seneca Canal of the village is in the Town of Fayette and a small area in the southeast of the village is in Town of Seneca Falls. Waterloo is east of Geneva and is located in between the two main Finger Lakes, Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The area was within the realm of the Cayuga nation, one of several bands to form the Iroquois League. The current site of the village was the location of the former Cayuga village "Skoiyase" (or Skoi-Yase), meaning "flowing water", which was established around 1500.
