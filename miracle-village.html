            Miracle Village (officially City of Refuge since 2014) is a community on Muck City Road, about three miles (4.8 km) east of Pahokee, Florida, that serves as a haven for registered sex offenders. It is located within one of the most isolated and poorest parts of Palm Beach County. The site was chosen because of its isolation given that the sex offender residence restrictions do not apply.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description ==<br/><br/>The complex of 54 duplexes and six family homes is operated by Matthew 25: Ministries, an organization with the stated goal of providing prison aftercare. The Executive Director in 2017 was Ted Rodarm, himself an ex-offender. In October 2010, the community included 66 registered sex offenders; by July 2013, there were 100; and by 2017, it held 120. The total population as of 2018, including family members, was 200. It is the largest community of registered sex offenders in the United States. There are an additional 300 who have resided there but since moved on.<br/><br/>An affiliated organization, Miracle Village Ministries, provides services including transportation to newly released prisoners.
