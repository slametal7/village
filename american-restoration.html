            American Restoration is an American reality television series airing on the History Channel. Produced by Leftfield Pictures, the first six seasons were recorded in Las Vegas, Nevada, where it chronicled the daily activities at Rick's Restorations, an antique restoration shop, with its owner Rick Dale, his staff, and teenage son, as they restore various vintage items to their original condition.<br/><br/>For season 7, History rebooted the program with a new concept and cast, with the series now following five American restoration shops.<br/><br/>The show is the first spin-off of Pawn Stars, in which Dale has appeared several times as an on-camera expert and restored various items. The series has featured cameo appearances by the cast of Pawn Stars, American Pickers, Counting Cars, illusionists Lance Burton and David Copperfield, NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, and musicians Sammy Hagar, Billy Joel, and Jason Mraz.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Format ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Seasons 1–6 ===<br/><br/>The series focuses on Rick's Restorations, a company owned and operated by Las Vegas area metal artist and antique restoration expert Rick Dale, who has been restoring various vintage items for almost 30 years. Dale and his company first appeared on the History reality television series Pawn Stars, in that show's first-season episode "Time Machines," and in nine subsequent episodes in which he restored numerous decades-old items for the Harrisons (owners of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop where Pawn Stars takes place), including vending machines, gas pumps, barber chairs, motorcycles, and jukeboxes.<br/><br/>Beginning with the June 6, 2012 episode ("Dirt Bike Duels"), a new feature, "Rick's Tips", was added preceding the second commercial break, in which Rick poses a question related to restoration, similar to the trivia question feature on Pawn Stars.<br/><br/>According to Dale, his shop typically works on 6 – 12 projects at any given time. Although he and his staff restore the items brought in by customers themselves, they are shown consulting other merchants and experts for parts, and calling in freelance employees, such as Bob, a metalworker, when their workload requires it.
