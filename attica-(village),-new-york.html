            Attica is a village in Wyoming and Genesee counties, New York, United States. The population was 2,547 at the 2010 census.<br/><br/>The village is on the northern border of Wyoming County. The village lies mostly within the town of Attica, but the northern part of the village is within the adjacent town of Alexander in Genesee County.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1802, Zerah Phelps became the first European-American landowner in the Attica area, which had  for centuries been part of territory of the Seneca Nation, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. As allies of the British, they were mostly forced out of New York after the American Revolution, when the Crown ceded control of its territory to the new United States.<br/><br/>He built and owned a gristmill, and was also the first business owner in Attica. By 1810 the settlement had grown into a town., Malaria and plague drove the settlers to higher ground. During the War of 1812, many people fled to this area from Buffalo, which was vulnerable to British attack from the Great Lakes.<br/><br/>In 1837, Phelps' Settlement was incorporated, becoming the village of Attica.
