            Mary's Igloo (Qawiaraq or Aġviġnaq in Iñupiaq) is an abandoned village located in the Nome Census Area of the Unorganized Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska, now used as a fish camp.  Many former residents and their descendants currently live in nearby Teller or the next largest community, Nome.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Inupiat village of Kauwerak was located about 15 miles (24 km) downriver from Mary's Igloo. By 1900, Kauwerak was abandoned and most of its residents moved to Teller or Nome because of schools and employment opportunities. A few settled at the site of Mary's Igloo, which they called Aukvaunlook (Aġviġnaq), meaning "black whale."<br/><br/>During the gold prospecting period of the early 1900s, non-Natives named the village "Mary's Igloo," after an Inupiaq woman named Mary, who welcomed miners, trappers and others into her home for coffee. During that period, Mary's Igloo was a transfer point for supplies for the gold fields upriver on the Kuzitrin and Kougarok rivers. The supplies were offloaded from ocean boats onto barges, which were towed to their destinations. A post office and store were opened at Mary's Igloo in 1901. By the 1910 census, Mary's Igloo was a community of 141 Inupiat and Anglo-Americans, who were miners, innkeepers, missionaries and support crews for the barges. It had schools, a post office and other services.
