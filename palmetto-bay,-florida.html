            Palmetto Bay is a suburban incorporated village in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. Palmetto Bay includes two neighborhoods that were former census-designated places, Cutler and East Perrine. The village is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 24,439 as of the 2020 US census.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In August 1992, Palmetto Bay and the surrounding South Miami-Dade area were severely damaged by Hurricane Andrew. Many of the homes and businesses in Palmetto Bay were destroyed. In the subsequent years, the area was slowly rebuilt. Although many areas of Miami were heavily affected by Hurricane Andrew, Palmetto Bay was one of the worst affected and remains a reminder of the hurricane's extensive disaster in the city today.<br/><br/>The village incorporated on September 10, 2002, taking the territory formerly held by the Cutler, Rockdale and East Perrine census-designated places. The founding council consisted of Mayor Eugene Flinn, Jr., Vice Mayor, Linda Robinson, and council members, John Breder, Edward Feller, and Paul Neidhart.
