<h1>Village West</h1>
            
            The West Village is a neighborhood in the western section of the larger Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City. The West Village is bounded by the Hudson River to the west and 14th Street to the north. The eastern boundary is variously cited as Greenwich Avenue, Seventh Avenue, or Sixth Avenue, while the southern boundary is either Houston Street or Christopher Street.<br/><br/>The West Village is part of Manhattan Community District 2, and is patrolled by the 6th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Residential property sale prices in West Village are among the most expensive in the United States, typically exceeding US$2,100 per square foot ($23,000/m2) in 2017.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The designation "West Village" emerged amidst successful preservation efforts in the 1950s–1960s. Residents and preservationists began using the designation "West Village" to distinguish this section of Greenwich Village from the portion of the Village east of Seventh Avenue surrounding Washington Square Park and New York University, where developers found more success in the redevelopment and demolition of historic blocks.<br/><br/>Other names have been given to portions of the area as changes have come to the neighborhood. For instance, beginning in the early 1980s, residential development spread in the Far West Village between West Street and Hudson Street, from West 14th Street to West Houston Street, resulting in the area being given its own name.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Preservation ===<br/><br/>Historically, local residents and preservation groups have been concerned about development in the Village and have fought to preserve the architectural and historic integrity of the neighborhood.
