            Malaeimi is a village in American Samoa, located in Tuālāuta County. The village is home to a large number of shops and restaurants, including eateries serving native cuisine alongside Filipino, Italian, Vietnamese, and American.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Malaeimi Valley contains an archaeological site designated AS-31-34, where Samoan ceramic potsherds have been discovered.<br/><br/>In late 1942, the Malaeimi Valley served as a site for jungle training exercises conducted by the United States Marine Corps. The U.S. military established facilities in Malaeimi Valley during World War II, including a state-of-the-art jungle warfare training center and a communications filter center. The installation featured a rifle range, the main filter center building, three officers' quarters with an associated latrine, three enlisted men's quarters with their own latrine, a mess hall, a movie projector, and a designated garbage platform. In late 1942, U.S. Marines began jungle training operations in Malaeimi Valley, but the program was halted due to high incidences of mosquito-borne illnesses. Consequently, between October 1942 and June 1943, the military evacuated 1,265 infected servicemen from Tutuila.<br/><br/>On October 9, 1987, the case Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Hodel was ruled to have invalidated the sale of land in Malaeimi to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, affirming the constitutional validity of restrictions limiting the ownership of native land in American Samoa to individuals of Samoan ancestry.
