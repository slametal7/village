<h2>Overview and Location</h2>
<p>Brookfield Village is a residential neighborhood located in East Oakland, California, approximately 5 miles southeast of downtown Oakland and adjacent to Oakland International Airport. The neighborhood is bounded roughly by Hegenberger Road to the north, Doolittle Drive to the south, 82nd Avenue to the west, and 106th Avenue to the east. The main thoroughfares are 98th Avenue and Edes Avenue, which serve as the commercial and social hubs of the community.</p>

<p>This working-class neighborhood features primarily single-family homes built in the 1940s and 1950s, with tree-lined streets and a suburban feel uncommon in much of urban Oakland. The area covers approximately 0.7 square miles and sits at an elevation of 30 feet above sea level, with relatively flat terrain typical of Oakland's eastern neighborhoods.</p>

<h2>Historical Development</h2>
<p>Brookfield Village was developed during World War II (1941-1945) in response to the massive influx of workers needed for the Bay Area's booming war industries. The neighborhood was constructed on land that had previously been zoned for industrial uses but was repurposed for urgent housing needs during the wartime housing shortage.</p>

<p>The development was spearheaded by Albert Bernhardt and the Stoneon Brothers, who envisioned creating a planned community that would offer quality housing for wartime workers and their families. The project comprised over 1,200 homes built in the then-popular "tract house" style, making it one of the first large-scale suburban-style developments in Oakland.</p>

<p>Key historical aspects of Brookfield Village's development include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Architectural Style</strong>: Primarily modest 2-3 bedroom bungalows with post-war utilitarian design</li>
<li><strong>Street Layout</strong>: Innovative winding, contoured streets designed to break from the grid pattern common in older Oakland neighborhoods</li>
<li><strong>Landscaping</strong>: Extensive planting of shade trees that have matured into the neighborhood's distinctive canopy</li>
<li><strong>Marketing</strong>: Advertised as "a model village on the Pacific Coast" emphasizing modern amenities and community planning</li>
</ul>
</p>
