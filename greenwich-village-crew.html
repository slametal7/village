            The Greenwich Village Crew is a crew within the Genovese crime family, active in the Greenwich Village area of Manhattan. It was originally controlled by Don Vito Genovese from the early 1920s until his arrest in the late 1950s. In the early 1980s capo Vincent Gigante, was made the new boss of the Genovese crime family. He continued to operate from and with the Greenwich Village Crew members. Today the crew is still active, but after the death of Dominick Canterino, it is uncertain who is controlling the crew.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Locations and activities ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The crew controlled many of the organized crime activities throughout downtown Manhattan, and some of the rackets included labor racketeering, gambling, loan sharking, hijackings, and extortion of businesses.
