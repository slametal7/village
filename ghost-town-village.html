            Ghost Town Village (formerly "Ghost Town in the Sky at Ghost Mountain Park") is an abandoned Wild West-themed amusement park in Maggie Valley, North Carolina, United States whose status is currently, as of March 2023, the subject of an ongoing lawsuit.   It sits atop Buck Mountain, with a top elevation of 4,650 ft (1,420 m). Ghost Town was promoted as "North Carolina's mile-high theme park."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Location ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The park is located on a ridge extending from Buck Mountain border, an extension of the Cataloochee Divide, to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park's entrance is located on U.S. Highway 19, the main road through the town of Maggie Valley. An unusual aspect of this park is that it is located atop a mountain which originally could only be accessed  by visitors via a 3,370-foot-long (1,030 m) chair lift or an inclined funicular railway. Attempts to move visitors to the park by bus proved problematic.(At one time visiting the closed park was possible via an abandoned road, but it is a private property and as of October 2019 the new owners have increased security and limited access.) These methods of transport to the park started at the parking area beside Jonathan Creek at an elevation of 3,150 feet (960 m), climbing to the lower level of the park at 4,400 feet (1,300 m), a climb of 1,250 feet (380 m). The recreated "Ghost Town" sits at 4,600 feet (1,400 m), with the highest elevation in the park being about 4,650 feet (1,420 m).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Folklore ===<br/><br/>The lost sheep of Uncle Dan Carpenter will never be found. The land to build the park was purchased from a local land owner named Uncle Dan Carpenter in 1960. The story is told that R.B. Coburn had overheard a story of Uncle Dan Carpenter losing his sheep in a large cavern on top of Buck Mountain.
