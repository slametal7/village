            The Métis ( meh-TEE(SS), French: [metis], Canadian French: [meˈt͡sɪs], Michif: [mɪˈt͡ʃɪf]) are a mixed-race Indigenous people whose historical homelands include Canada's three Prairie Provinces extending into parts of Ontario, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and the northwest United States. They have a shared history and culture, deriving from specific mixed European (primarily French, Scottish, and English) and Indigenous ancestry (primarily Cree with strong kinship to Cree people and communities), which became distinct through ethnogenesis by the mid-18th century, during the early years of the North American fur trade.<br/><br/>In Canada, the Métis, with a population of 624,220 as of 2021, are one of three legally recognized Indigenous peoples in the Constitution Act, 1982, along with the First Nations and Inuit.<br/><br/>The term Métis (uppercase 'M') typically refers to the specific community of people defined as the Métis Nation, which originated largely in the Red River Valley and organized politically in the 19th century, radiating outwards from the Red River Settlement (now Winnipeg). Descendants of this community are known as the Red River Métis. In 1870, the Métis Provisional Government of Louis Riel negotiated the entry of the Red River Settlement into Confederation as the Province of Manitoba, making Manitoba the only province to be founded by an Indigenous person.<br/><br/>The Métis National Council (MNC) is the political organization, that represents the Métis Nation at the national and international levels. In 2002, the MNC defined Métis as: "a person who self-identifies as Métis, is distinct from other Aboriginal Peoples, is of historic Métis Nation ancestry and who is accepted by the Métis Nation."<br/><br/>First Nations are disputing this.<br/><br/>Alberta is the only Canadian province with a recognized Métis land base: the eight Métis settlements, with a population of approximately 5,000 people on 1.25 million acres (5,100 km2) and the newer Metis lands near Fort McKay, purchased from the Government of Alberta in 2017.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Etymology ===<br/><br/>The word métis itself is originally French for 'person of mixed parentage' and derives from the Latin word mixticius, from mixtus, 'mixed'.
