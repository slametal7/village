            Waukesha is a village in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 8,457 at the 2020 census. The City of Waukesha is located adjacent to the village.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Originally part of the Town of Muskego, the Town of Prairie Village (soon renamed Prairieville) was named after the Native American settlement in that area. The town was renamed in 1847, soon after the new Waukesha County was created from the western portion of Milwaukee County. On January 10, 1852, the settled area once known as Prairieville was separated from the Town of Waukesha, and incorporated as the village (later the city) of Waukesha. The remainder of the town continued to bear the name as well (as is customary in Wisconsin).<br/><br/>On May 12, 2020, the former town of Waukesha incorporated as a village following a referendum where residents voted 9-to-1 in favor of incorporation. While the City of Waukesha sued, challenging the legality of the incorporation, the Village eventually won the fight after the Wisconsin Supreme Court let a lower court ruling stand that upheld the incorporation. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geography ==<br/><br/>According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 23.0 square miles (59.5 km2), of which, 22.9 square miles (59.3 km2) of it is land, and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) of it (0.44%) is water.
