            Hempstead is a village located in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 59,169 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous village in New York.<br/><br/>The Incorporated Village of Hempstead is the site of the seventeenth-century "town spot" from which English and Dutch settlers developed the Town of Hempstead, the Town of North Hempstead, and ultimately Nassau County. It is the largest community by population in both the Town of Hempstead and Nassau County.<br/><br/>Hofstra University is partially located in Hempstead.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>Hempstead may have been named after Hemel Hempstead in the English county of Hertfordshire, where village founder John Carman was born. Another theory regarding the origin of the village's name is that it is derived from the town of Heemstede in the Netherlands, as this was an area from which many Dutch settlers of New Netherland originated.<br/><br/>In 1664, the new settlement adopted the Duke's Laws, an austere set of laws that became the basis upon which the laws of many colonies were to be founded. For a time, Hempstead became known as "Old Blue," as a result of the blue laws.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Foundation ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The land on which the Village of Hempstead stands was under Dutch control from the early 1620s.
