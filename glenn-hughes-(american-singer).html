            Glenn Michael  Hughes (July 18, 1950 – March 4, 2001) was an American singer who was the original "Leatherman" character in the disco group Village People from 1977 to 1996.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>He graduated in 1968 from Chaminade High School, and then attended Manhattan University, where he was initiated as a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1969. He was interested in motorcycles, and was working as a toll collector at the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel when he responded to an advertisement by composer Jacques Morali seeking "macho" singers and dancers. Hughes and other members of the band were given a crash course in the synchronized dance choreography that later typified the group's live performances.<br/><br/>Hughes sported an extravagant horseshoe moustache and wore his trademark leather outfit on and off stage and became one of the iconic figures of the disco era. According to Jack Fritscher, Jacques Morali drew his inspiration for the character from the gay BDSM leather bar and sex club of the  Mineshaft's dress code. Hughes frequented the club. He was a bike fanatic in real life and kept his motorcycle parked inside his house.<br/><br/>Hughes was named on People's 1979 list of 'Most Beautiful People' and appeared in the television special The Playboy Mansion with Hugh Hefner.<br/><br/>In 1996, Hughes retired from the group and launched a successful New York cabaret act until he was diagnosed with lung cancer.
