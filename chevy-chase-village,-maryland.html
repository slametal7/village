Newlands bought more than 1,700 acres in upper Northwest D.C. and southern Montgomery County and began to develop a streetcar suburb he dubbed Chevy Chase.<br/><br/>Newlands' Chevy Chase Land Company divided the Maryland land into subdivisions; Sections 1, 1a, and 2 became known as the Village of Chevy Chase. In 1914, Village residents sought and received state sanction as a special taxing area.
